The libdisorder project is a simple C library for entropy measurement of
byte streams and other data.

The homepage is:

You can also retrieve the code from:

     http://code.dyne.org/?r=libdisorder

Plans include adding new entropy measurement functions as well as a module
for supporting the parsing or chunking of data format tokens (for example,
this mechanism would support measuring the entropy of an HTML document in
terms of the tags it uses, where each tag is considered a "token"). This
mechanism can be extended to any structured data format: files, network
protocols, etc.
