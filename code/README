libdisorder: entropy measurement
$Id$
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a readme file. See 

     http://www.cs.gmu.edu/~mlocasto/research/libdisorder

for more information.

libdisorder is a small, simple C library for use by programmars in
other programs. There is a small test program included that opens
/dev/urandom and calls libdisorder.

You will probably want to pipe the output of libdisorder to some other
math analysis or graphing environment. In *nix, you can use gnuplot.

The library's primary function reports entropy in bits: essentially,
this is the number of bits necessary to encode the actual level of
information contained in the data passed to the library: it is the
theoretical maximum amount of compression possible.
